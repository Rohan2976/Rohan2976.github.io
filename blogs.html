A special feature of Ahmedabad is the plan of the old city comprising numerous pols, self-contained neighborhoods, sheltering large numbers of peoples. Some of these virtually small villages, traversed by narrow streets, usually terminating in square with community wells and chabutaras for feeding birds, gates, Cul-de-sacs and secret passages. To experience the glory of Ahmedabad, it is necessary to walk through an old quarter and truly observe the nature of its architecture, its art, religious places, its culture and traditions. 

With the purpose of unveiling the city to the tourists and the citizens themselves, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has arranged this HERITAGE WALK OF AHMEDABAD..</div>

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, located north of Ahmedabad, was originally the residence of Mahatma Gandhi and his spouse Kasturba. The ashram is flanked by a calm and quiet stretch by the Sabarmati River. This is also the location where Gandhi started his Dandi March from. Because it was located in between a prison and a cemetery, Gandhi believed that a Satyagrahi would certainly end his life in either a prison or a graveyard. Sabarmati Ashram will reawaken your sense of independence. The museum is the most well-known of the many institutions within the Sabarmati ashram's grounds.
Various personal letters and images of Gandhi are displayed throughout the space. Upasana Mandir, Magan Niwas, Vinoba, Nandini, and Kutir are some of the ashram's other structures. The ashram is now a historical site, having witnessed numerous historical occurrences. You can also visit this place and learn more about India's ancient history..</div>

It was declared a memorial for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his centennial birth anniversary on 7 March 1980.</div>

The Gujarat Vidyapith was started in Dahyabhai Mehta's bungalow behind the Kocharab Ashram (the Kocharab Aashram was started in barrister Jivanlal Desai's bungalow).

Its purpose was to promote educational institutions run by Indians for Indians outside the financial and governing control of British authorities. The university helped nationalists establish a system of education for all Indians, thus proving the country's independence from British-run institutions and de-legitimizing the British Raj. Its foundation was one of the important event of an initiative satyagraha launched by Gandhi as a means to peacefully terminate British rule in India.</div>

Traditional artisans working in stone belonged to the Sonpura & Salat communities. The Salat community constructed masterpieces of architecture ranging from forts, palaces to temples. The work of the Hutheesing Jain temple is attributed to Premchand Salat. One scholar has remarked, "Each part goes on increasing in dignity as we approach the sanctuary. Whether looked at from its courts or from the outside, it possesses variety without confusion and appropriateness of every part to the purpose for which it was intended."</div>
